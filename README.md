# Node-Starter project
ExpressJs - SequelizeJs - PassportJs

## Intro

This project is an [ExpressJs](http://expressjs.com/) base to build NodeJs API. It use the orm [SequelizeJs](http://sequelizejs.com/) and the module [PassportJs](http://passportjs.org/) for user authentication.
You can clone this project and use it to quickly build your Node API.

## Quick start

After cloning the project, install Node modules :

```
cd my_project/
npm install
```

When dependencies are installed, we can initialise the database config and sequelize migrations :

```
./node_modules/.bin/sequelize init
```

This command create a config.json file in your config folder. You can edit it and add your database config. You should create a .env file and edit your environment variables inside :
DB_USERNAME = "your_username_database"
DB_PASSWORD = "your_password_database"
DB_DATABASE = "your_name_database"
DB_HOST = "your_host_database"
DB_DIALECT = "your_dialect_database"
DB_PORT = your_port_database

MAIL_SERVICE = "your_service"
MAIL_USER = "your_email"
MAIL_PASSWORD = "your_password_email"
MAIL_FROM = "your_from_email"


When your database config is set, run the migration :

```
./node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate
```

This command create the user table with all its attributes. You can find more explication on the [Sequelize website](http://sequelizejs.com/docs/latest/migrations).

You can now start your app :

```
npm start
```

## Social network authentications

For social network authentications, you should create an application on each social network's website. When you create an app, for exemple a facebook app, facebook give you an ID and a secret key. Add this configurations on the environement file (.env).
Facebook : https://developers.facebook.com/
Twitter :  https://apps.twitter.com/
Google : https://cloud.google.com/

Default name of variables to use :

FACEBOOK_AUTH_CLIENT_ID = "your_facebook_client_id"
FACEBOOK_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET = "your_facebook_client_secret"
FACEBOOK_AUTH_CALLBACK_URL = "your_facebook_callback_url"

TWITTER_AUTH_CONSUMER_KEY = "your_twitter_consumer_key"
TWITTER_AUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET = "your_twitter_consumer_secret"
TWITTER_AUTH_CALLBACK_URL = "your_twitter_callback_url"

GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID = "your_google_client_id"
GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET = "your_google_client_secret"
GOOGLE_AUTH_CALLBACK_URL = "your_google_callback_url"
