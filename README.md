# Node-Starter project
ExpressJs - SequelizeJs - PassportJs

## Intro

This project is an [ExpressJs](http://expressjs.com/) base to build NodeJs API. It use the orm [SequelizeJs](http://sequelizejs.com/) and the module [PassportJs](http://passportjs.org/) for user authentication.
You can clone this project and use it to quickly build your Node API.

## Quick start

After cloning the project, install Node modules :

```
cd my_project/
npm install
```

When dependencies are installed, we can initialise the database config and sequelize migrations :

```
./node_modules/.bin/sequelize init
```

This command create a config.json file in your config folder. You can edit it and add your database config. You should edit the configuration of your development environment too (config/env folder).

When your database config is set, run the migration :

```
./node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:migrate
```

This command create the user table with all its attributes. You can find more explication on the [Sequelize website](http://sequelizejs.com/docs/latest/migrations).

You can now start your app :

```
npm start
```

## Social network authentications

For social network authentications, you should create an application on each social network's website. When you create an app, for exemple a facebook app, facebook give you an ID and a secret key. Add this configurations on the environement file (config/env folder).

Twitter :  https://apps.twitter.com/

## Tests

Tests are ready to be written. They should be placed in the test folder. By default, Node-Starter use the test runner framework [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) but you can remove it and use whatever you want.

You should just run this command to run the tests :

```
npm test
```
